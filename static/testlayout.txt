Now the question arises what is directory enumeration, Directory enumeration is same as described in subdomain enumeration, instead of bruteforcing for possible active subdomains
    we finds hidden directories for finding contents that website consist which donot meant to be publcily available or the directory that contains some sensitive information.
    It is not necessary that the directory do contain only sensitive data but it can also have same functionalities that unauthorised segment of website contains instead it can retain
    some other technologies other than home directories. If this directory have other functionalities it is possible that it do have outdated technologies in use which can be exploited
    further to find vunerabilities or bugs in website.

    So Directory enumeration is must after bruteforcing for subdomains.
